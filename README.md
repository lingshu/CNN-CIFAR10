# CNN-CIFAR10
 I am creating a  Convolutional  Neural  Network  using  TensorFlow. The network is trained on the CIFAR10 dataset and learn to classify images into 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.

 The train data can be found here: https://github.com/lingshu/DNN---CIFAR10/tree/master/cifar10-hw1
